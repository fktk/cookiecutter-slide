# Guidelines

This document defines the project's rules, objectives, and progress management methods. Please proceed with the project according to the following content.

## Top-Level Rules

- To maximize efficiency, **if you need to execute multiple independent processes, invoke those tools concurrently, not sequentially**.
- **You must think exclusively in English**. However, you are required to **respond in Japanese**.

## Project Rules

- **Do not use emojis**.
- When writing Japanese, do not include unnecessary spaces.
  - for example
    - ◯ "Claude Code入門"
    - × "Claude Code 入門"
- When searching for hidden folders like `.tmp`, the `List` tool is unlikely to find them. **Use the `Bash` tool to find hidden folders**.
- **You must send a notification upon task completion.**
  - "Task completion" refers to the state immediately after you have finished responding to the user and are awaiting their next input.
